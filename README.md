**Let's See How To Print Logos On Custom Boxes With Unique Ideas**

Here are a few cool ideas for printing logos on [**custom boxes**](https://www.thecustomboxes.com/) as follows:

### **1\. The "Hidden" or Subtle Logo**

**Glossy on Matte:** Print a clear, glossy version of your logo on a matte-finish box. It feels very high-end and special.

**Same-Color Printing:** Print your logo using ink that's the same or a very similar color to the box itself. It's a clean, minimalist look that customers have to look closely to notice.

### **2\. Think About Placement**

**The Corner Crease:** Print your logo so it wraps around a corner or a crease of the box. This makes the design interactive and unexpected.

**Inside the Box:** The outside might be plain, but when the customer opens it up, your logo is big and bold on the inside lid. This creates a "surprise" moment.

**3\. Use Texture and Special Finishes**

**Embossing or Debossing:**

1.  Embossing means raising the logo off the surface of the box, giving it a cool 3D feel.
    
2.  Debossing means pressing the logo down into the box, creating an elegant, sunken look.
    
3.  Both of these methods look great without any ink at all, using just the box material.
